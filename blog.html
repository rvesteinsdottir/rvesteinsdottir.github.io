            9.21.2019 || Gluten free biscuits
          </h3>
          <p>
            Over break week I attempted to make some <a href="https://www.mamaknowsglutenfree.com/gluten-free-biscuits/" target="_blank">gluten free buttermilk biscuits</a> with some leftover buttermilk from a previous cooking project. Deeply afraid of re-producing an earlier gf biscuit attempt that resulted in dry, crumbly cardboard-like biscuits, I spent a lot of time trying to avoid this project. Luckily, the frozen butter and cup of buttermilk in this recipe retained moisture like nobody's business, and the resulting biscuits were soft, sweet and perfectly salty. I would highly recommend this recipe if you have leftover buttermilk and a little bit of time to spare in the morning!

            8.30.2019 || A gluten free birthday cake
          </h3>
          <p>
            Over the weekend I was tasked with making a chocolate birthday cake for a family friend's birthday dinner. My go-to recipe, recommended by another gluten free baker, is this delicious <a href="https://www.whattheforkfoodblog.com/2017/04/24/the-best-gluten-free-chocolate-cake-recipe/">chocolate gluten free cake</a> that uses fresh coffee and buttermilk to retain moisture. I usually forgo the buttercream frosting for a tart cream cheese frosting to balance out the sugar rush from the cake. Top with berries and birthday candles and you've got yourself a birthday cake for everyone to enjoy!

            8.22.2019 || Dosas, courtesy of S
          </h3>
          <p>
            This week I made a much needed to trip to visit an auntie on the East side. After feeding me copious amounts of Indian food she sent me home with some leftover dosa batter to cook up. So, on a slow morning I walked to the store to grab some potatoes for dosa stuffing. The recipe for aloo masala (spiced potatoes) comes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/000-Indian-Recipes/dp/0764519727">1,000 Indian Recipes</a>, a cookbook my mother always references for her go-to recipes. Thanks to S's wonderful cilantro-coconut chutney, I've been enjoying morning dosas for the past few days.

            7.23.2019 || Kombucha, round one
          </h3>
          <p>
            After a recent conversation with a doctor that practices systems medicine, I made a commitment to myself to take better care of my digestive system. I decided to start making my own kombucha from scratch, scoby and all. After doing too much research and freaking myself out about the possibility of botulism, I started by <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-your-own-kombucha-scoby-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-202596">cultivating my own scoby</a>. This process was relatively simple and got me excited about brewing the actual kombucha. For my first kombucha attempt I used a recipe from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng2zOFADe0s">Bon Appetit video</a>. My second fermentation with strawberry and mint resulted in tasty, but overly sweet, kombucha. Next time, I'll use less sugar.
