        <p>
          Raisah is currently a student at <a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> and she is thrilled to begin her career as a software developer. Raisah joined Ada because programming allows her to combine my love of problem solving with my deep commitment to the Seattle community. 

          Working alongside driven and thoughtful Ada students has expanded Raisahâ€™s conception of what we can accomplish through software development with a diverse workforce. Raisah believes in the power of data to reduce inequalities and provide more people with the tools they need to succeed. She looks forward to bringing her problem-solving skills, creativity and passion for learning to this next phase as an intern.
